This simple one page portfolio website was made using HTML5, CSS3, and the JQuery. 
Animation on scroll, google fonts, and font awesome were used for styling and animations.
JQuery was used for the navigation bar, toggling the navigation links to show in fullscreen and scrolling to the section to which the links referred to.
With JQuery I also created a button on the bottom right to scroll back to top of site.
